## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

A simple plot.

```{python}
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-alt: "Plot of x cubed versus x."
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

xpoints = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)
ypoints = np.power(xpoints, 3)

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
import platform

print(platform.machine())
print(platform.python_version())
print(platform.architecture())
```
